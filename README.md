Description
-----------

The ability of software-engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate
solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and
fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional
career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

Introduction
------------

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However,
this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full
computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in
both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students
new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment,
the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to
working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the
student.

How to submit
-------------

Your code will be automatically verified according to the criteria found in the final assignment description. For the automatic verification, we make use of AutoGradr. Make sure to register an account at <http://AutoGradr.com>!

The criteria in the final assignment document are implemented as rules in AutoGradr, therefore your application should strictly adhere to these criteria. Each week has a project in AutoGradr. You will need to submit the code that implements the functionality as written in the weekly assignments with these projects in AutoGradr.

![Cover Image](docs/img/autogradr_bottom.png)

In AutoGradr you will find a number of test cases in the right region of your screen. Typically, half of the test cases are hidden and half of the test cases are visible. The test case itself is displayed in the left region. A blue line denotes input to your application, while a black line denotes the expected output from your application.

![Cover Image](docs/img/autogradr_top.png)

Below the test case, you can submit your application. Note that the name of the entry-point to your application should be *main.py*. In case your application consists of multiple files, you can upload a zip containing all the files.

Remember to check that the programming language is set to Python 3.

When you have uploaded your file(s), AutoGradr will automatically verify your solution and present you with the result. In case your solution does not pass, it will display the lines of output that are incorrect and what was expected. Please note that this is only shown for test cases that are visible and not for hidden test cases.

When your solution passes, AutoGradr will tell you that every test case has passed.

When to submit
--------------

Refer to the schedule above. We will keep track of your weekly progress which is part of your grade. We therefore require you to have passed each weekly assignment _before_ the deadline.
